            My name is soham Gupta. My hobby is to read. I am currently reading Keeper Of The Lost Cities. I am on the third book called Keeper Of The Lost Cities Everblaze. The series is- Keeper Of The Lost Cities, Keeper Of The Lost Cities Exile, Keeper Of The Lost Cities Everblaze, Keeper Of The Lost Cities Neverseen, Keeper Of The Lost Cities Lodestar, Keeper Of The Lost Cities Nightfall, Keeper Of The Lost Cities flashback and Keeper Of The Lost Cities Legacy. It is a very good book series writen by Shannon Mesengar.

        This specific series is my favourite series. Just like mentioned on the cover, it is perfect for fans of harry potter. It includes a whole new world of elves from a different prepective than what we see elves like. Except for the pointy ears of course!! It has nice vocabulary and the plot is amazing. At the end of each book she leaves the story a bit incomplete which makes the readers curious on what is going to happen next.
